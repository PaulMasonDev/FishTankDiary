This app allows you to keep track of various water measurements such as pH and ammonia levels and whether or not the water was changed via the use of a form posting system.  There is also a notes section where you can add your own information not captured with the form.

Create/Read/Update/Delete functionality has been added for both the "posts" and the "comments" that can be added to each post.
